## About

Hi, I'm John. Here is some relevant (and possibly irrelevant) information about me:

- I am based in Brooklyn, NY.

- I have an interest in physically based shading, parallel algorithms, VFX, and technical art. 

- I am currently a Senior Graphics Engineer at Unity Technologies, working on the High-Definition Render Pipeline. 

- What I love about real-time computer graphics is how it forces our hand, as developers, to reconcile the physics of light transport with tight hardware constraints; resulting in clever ideas, and great engineering. 

- I share the results of some of my amateur technical art work on this [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/omnnai/?hl=en) page. 

- In my free time I like to boulder or read. My favorite book is William Gaddis' _The Recognitions_.
