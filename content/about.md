## About

Hi, I'm John. Here is some relevant (and possibly irrelevant) information about me:

- I am based in Brooklyn, New York.

- I have an interest in physically based shading, parallel algorithms, visual effects, and technical art. 

- I am currently a Staff Graphics Engineer at Unity Technologies. 

- What I love about real-time computer graphics is how it forces us to reconcile our observations of light, materials, and geometry with tight hardware constraints; resulting in clever ideas, and great engineering.

- You can find me at industry conferences, where I love to share the knowledge I learn along my way. I recently spoke about my work on hair shading and rendering at SIGGRAPH 2022, which you can check out [here](https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2022/SIGGRAPH2022-Advances-Enemies-Ciardi%20et%20al.pdf). 

- I share the results of some of my amateur technical art work on this [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/omnnai/?hl=en) page. 

- In my free time I like to boulder or read. My favorite book is William Gaddis' _The Recognitions_. 

- Here is my [resume](../resume.pdf) and a [reel]({{< ref "/reel" >}}) of some stuff I have worked on. 

- Otherwise if you would like to reach out, you can contact me directly at parsaiej@gmail.com
